Sup Nathan?

These scripts are my attempt to recode 3 exercises worth of Visual Scripting
into C#. I went in completely over my head, thinking I had a decent enough
understanding of C# to overhaul the entire project (I didn't).

Hopefully when I finish my final, I can understand how objects in Unity
communicate under the hood, although this is probably a foolish errand that
only serves to satisfy my own unending curiosity about how computers and
software work.

TL;DR none of these scripts ever get used lmfao
